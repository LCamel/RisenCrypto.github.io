- This blog is built on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)   

- I do not use Ruby & other tools locally to build it. Forked from [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/) so everything can be done online.

- I use [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Here are the [instructions](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html) to integrate it into Github pages.

- Using [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments.
