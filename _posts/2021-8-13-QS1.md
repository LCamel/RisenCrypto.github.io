title: The Quadratic Sieve algorithm for Integer Factorization

---

{% include mathjax.html %}  

The Quadratic Sieve is the second fastest algorithm for factoring large semiprimes. It's the fastest for factoring ones which are lesser than 100 digits long.   

Some Background first. 

Most commonly used factorization methods today rely on a simple mathematical Identity    

$X^2 - Y^2 = (X+Y)(X-Y)$

**Fermat's Factorization**  

To factor $N$ we look for an integer $b$ such that $N + b^2$ is a perfect square.

i.e. $N^2 + b^2 = a^2$  

So $N = a^2 - b^2$

$N = (a + b)(a - b)$  

So we have factored $N$.

For e.g. Let $N = 8051$   

Try $8051 + 1^2, 8051 + 2^2, 8051 + 3^2 .....$, till we hit

$8051 + 7^2 = 90^2$

So $8051 = (90 + 7)(90 - 7)$   

$= 83$ x $97$

$\sqrt(8051) = 89.73$ 

So both factors in this case are quite close to the square root.

The further away the 2 factors of $N$ are away from $\sqrt(N)$, the more difficult this method becomes. Only a small fraction of numbers have a factor close to their square root.

Let's take $N = 799$. It will take us trying from 1 to 15, till we find $799 + 15^2 = 32^2$

So $799 = 17 * 47$

Obviously, with very large semiprimes, this method would take too long to be practical.

**Kraitchik's improvement** 

Kraitchik reasoned that instead of trying to find a & b such that $a^2 - b^2 = N$, it may be sufficient to find ones such that it's equal to a multiple of N.

For e.g. try with $3 * 799$ instead of 799.

$3 * 799 = 2397$  

Try $2397 + 1^2, 2397 + 2^2$ etc.   

We get a square right at the 2nd try

$2397 + 2^2 = 49^2$

A small change in this method is we now need $gcd(N, a + b)$ and/or $gcd(N, a - b)$ to find the factors

$gcd(799, 49 + 2) = 17$

So we get $799 = 17 * 47$   

What we did here is $kN + b^2 = a^2$  

This can also be represented as a Congruence i.e. 

$a^2 \equiv b^2 \bmod N$  

So the same thing could be done starting with $ceil(\sqrt 799) = 29$ 

$29^2 \bmod 799$ - not a square 

$30^2 \bmod 799$ - not a square 

$31^2 \bmod 799$ - not a square 

$32^2 \bmod 799 \equiv 225 = 15^2$

$799 = (32 + 15) . (32 - 15) = 47 * 17$

**Dixon's Factorization**   

Dixon replaced the condition "is a square" with a much weaker condition "is a product of small prime powers". These are easier to find. Once you find several of them, you then combine them by multiplication to find a combination which is a square. 

$N = 63787$   

$439^2 \bmod 63787 \equiv 1360 = 2^4 * 5 * 17$  

$445^2 \bmod 63787 \equiv 6664 = 2^3 * 7^2 * 17$

$449^2 \bmod 63787 \equiv 10240 = 2^{11} * 5$

Multiply the above 3 congruences  


$(439^2 * 445^2 * 449^2) \equiv (2^{18} * 5^2 * 7^2 * 17^2) \bmod 63787$

$7270^2 = 49492^2 \bmod 64787$

$gcd(63787, 49492 + 7270) = 281$

$63787 = 281 * 227$  

The Factorisation is complete.   

Most modern factorization methods use this procedure   

1. **Relation Building:** Find many integers such that each is a Quadratic Residue $\bmod N$. Find many $c_i$ such that $c_i \equiv {a_i}^2 \bmod N$.   

2. **Elimination:** Take a product of some of the $c_i$'s such that their product is a product of even prime powers. i.e ${c_i}_1 . {c_i}_2 . {c_i}_3 ... \equiv b^2 \bmod N$. 

3. **GCD Computation:** Use $gcd(N, a - b)$ to find the factors of $N$. There is a reasonable chance that the gcd is a factor of $N$   


In Step 1 we look for Quadratic residues $c_i$'s which are B-Smooth. To factor $N$, we can calculate an approximate value of $B$ using the formula  

$L =  e^{\sqrt {\ln(N)ln(ln(N))}}$

$B \approx L^{\frac {1}{\sqrt 2}}$

If we want to factor $N = 87463$, we calculate $B \approx 42$. So we are looking for 43-Smooth Quadratic Residues $\bmod N$. 

The first question is how do we achieve Step 1 - find many 43-smooth integers such that they are a Quadratic Residue $\bmod N$. Enter the Quadratic Sieve Algorithm. If you are unfamiliar with what 'Sieving' in general is, then you can lookup the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes'.

**Quadratic Sieve**   

We use a Quadratic Polynomial to do the sieving - hence the name Quadratic Sieve.  

One such polynomial is $F(T) = T^2 - N$. We start with a $T$ which is slightly larger than $\sqrt N$ 

$\sqrt 87463 = 295.74$. So we start with a = 296.  

We look at the list of numbers $F(a), F(a+1), F(a+2) ...$ to sieve    

$F(a) = 296^2 - N = 153$, $F(a+1) = 297^2 - N = 746$, $F(a+2) = 298^2 - N = 1341$ and so on & so forth. 

Our list $LS$ is now $LS$ = {153, 746, 1341, 1938, 2537, 3138, 3741, ....}

We try to find 43-smooth numbers in this list by sieving away by prime numbers smaller than or equal to 43 and checking which numbers in the list get sieved all the way down to 1.

First we build what is called as the Factor Base - this is a list of all primes lesser than or equal to B.

{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41 ,43}

However, there may be some numbers in our list which are not divisible by any of the primes in the factor base. So we can remove them from the Factor Base. Euler's Criteria for Quadratic Residues can be used to check if N is a Quadratic Residue for any of the odd primes. If $N^{\frac {p-1}{2}} \bmod p \ne 1$, then $N$ is not a QR for that odd prime, hence that prime is not going to divide any of the numbers in our list. For 2, which is an even prime, we can check manually.

Using the above, we can reduce the factor base to 

$FB$ = {2, 3, 13, 17, 19, 29, 41, 43} - so these are all the primes we are going to sieve our list with.   

Our List which we already generated is 

$LS = {153, 746, 1341, 1938, 2537, 3138, 3741, ....}$  

We start with 2. We take each number in the List LS & divide it each number in the Factor Base FB.

The First number in the list is 153. We cannot sieve it by 2 because it's not divisible by 2. Next we try with the next prime in the FB, i.e. 3 - it's divisible by 3 & gives 51, 51 again is divisible by 3 giving 17 - i.e. the original number got divided by 3 twice, i.e. one of it's factors is $3^2$. Next number in the FB is 13, but 17 is not divisible by 13, so we move on to the next prime in the FB, i.e. 17. 17 divides 17 & give us 1. When we reach one, it means we have found a Smooth number.  

$153 = 3^2 * 17$  

One thing to notice here is that checking whether a number is divisible by the prime by using trial division may be expensive. We can avoid this by using the roots to figure out which numbers in the list are going to be divisible by a particular prime.  

For e.g. for the prime $p_i$, the roots of $N \bmod p_i$ will help figure out. The roots can be found using the Tonelliâ€“Shanks algorithm

Let's try it for $p_i = 13$. I am using sagemath here to find the roots of $N \bmod 13$

sage: Mod(87463, 13).sqrt(all=True)

[5, 8]

This gives 2 roots - 5 & 8. Now, since we are starting from 296, we need to adjust the roots to get the Index/Position of the root in our list of Numbers. This can be trivially done - Mod (5 - 296, 13) = 8 & Mod(8-296, 13) = 11. 

In our list LS if we start the indexing with 0, this means that the 8th & 11th number will be divisible by 13.  Also, 8+13th, 8+26th, 8+39th etc & 11+13th, 11+26th, 11+39th etc number will be divisible by 13. This can be used to avoid trial division & only sieve numbers at that position.   

Here is a Google Spreadsheet I created to show the the Sieving process.  

[Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mWJSKojkZtnXiJ332plIN1UPdYHN5k5SCG9G7_Fld10/)

Row 3 is the Factor Base. Many of the primes have 2 roots for $N \bmod p_i$ & hence those appear twice in the roow.

Row 4 has the roots for the prime above it.  

Row 5 is the Adjusted Root - Calculated by a formula For e.g. for Cell D5 it's calculated as Mod(D4-B2,D3)

Column C contains the list of numbers we are going to sieve with the primes in the Factor Base.

We use the following Google Sheets script function to do the sieving

---   
<pre> <code>
function Sieve(no, p) 
{
  while (no % p == 0)
  {
    no = no/p;
  }
  return no;  
}
</code></pre>
--- 

Cells D7:R58 contain a formula (all the cells contain the same formula adjusted for Row & Column Numbers). 

This is the Formula in D7 

=If(Mod(<span>$</span>A7,D<span>$</span>3) = D<span>$</span>5,Sieve(C7,D<span>$</span>3),C7)

For any cell if the position/index of the row matches with the Adjusted root, then we call the funtion Sieve on that cell passing the number to be Sieved (the cell to the left of the current cell) & also the prime to Sieve it with. The Sieve function doesn't stop at a single divison by the prime, it keep dividing repeatedly till it finds the exact prime power which divides the number. 

So the Sieving is done. All those numbers which got divided all the way to 1 are our Smooth numbers 

We have found the following Smooth Numbers 

1. $296^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 153$ and $153 = 31^2 * 17$

2. $299^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 1938$ and $11938 = 2 * 3 * 17 * 19$

3. $302^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 3741$ and $3741 = 3 * 29 * 43$

4. $307^2  \bmod 87463 \equiv 6786$ and $6786 = 2 * 3^2 * 13 * 29$

5. $316^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 12393$ and $12393 = 3^6 * 17$   

6. $343^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 30186$ and $30186 = 2 * 3^3 * 13 * 43$

7. $347^2 \bmod 87463 \equiv 32946$ and $32946 = 2 * 3 * 17^2 * 19$

One thing we didn't look at is how many $F(T)$'s should we sieve? There is no formula to calculate this, but usually you should contine till you find atleast 5 more smooth numbers than the number of primes in your Factor Base. 

The remaining steps of factorization (Elimination & GCD) are not part of the Quadratic Sieving algorithm itself. They are used in all Factorization methods once the Relationship Building step is completed

**Elimination & GCD:**  

Every positive integer m has an exponent vector v(m) that is based on the prime factorization of m

For e.g. the exponent vector for $6786 = 2 * 3^2 * 13 * 29$ can be written as

v(6786) = {1	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0}

i.e. $6786 = 2^1 . 3^2 . 13^1 . 17^0 . 19^0 . 21^0 . 29^1 . 41^0 . 43^0$

When 2 numbers are multiplied, then their exponents get added. So the exponent vector for the result of the combination would the sum of the exponent vectors. The result would only be a square if each position in the component vector of the result is an even number. We can simplify this further by taking mod of each element of the exponent vector by 2 & then adding them mod 2 (which would tell is if the product would be a square if the sum is 0 for each element of the exponent vectorproduct).  

This now reduces to a Linear Algebra problem. 


We have 
$A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$

where 

$$ A = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
    0&1&0&1&0&1&1 \\ 
    0&1&1&0&0&1&1 \\
    0&0&0&1&0&1&0 \\
    1&1&0&0&1&0&0 \\
    0&1&0&0&0&0&1 \\
    0&0&0&0&0&0&0 \\
    0&1&0&1&0&0&0 \\
    0&0&0&0&0&0&0 \\
    0&1&0&0&0&1&0 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

Each column of A is the exponent vector of a Smooth Number we found through Sieving. And the equation is over $\mathbb{F}_2$  

We can find $\vec{x}$ by computing Kernel. Gaussian Elimination can be used for finding a basis for the kernel.

Doing it in SageMath ![Sagemath](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RisenCrypto/RisenCrypto.github.io/master/images/SageQS.png )

So we get the following vectors (written horizontally instead of vertically)  

v1 = [1 0 0 0 1 0 0] (i.e. multiply the squares of 1st & 5th Number - $296^2 * 316^2$)   

v2 = [0 1 0 0 1 0 1] (i.e. multiply the 2nd, 5th & 7th number - $299^2 * 316^2 * 347^2$)

v3 = [0 0 1 1 0 1 0] (i.e. multiply the 3rd, 4th & 6th number - $302^2 * 307^2 * 343^2$)


The first one tells us that multiply the 1st & the 5th smooth number may help us factorize $N$  

$296^2 * 316^2 \equiv (3^2 . 17)(3^6 . 17) \bmod 87463$   

$=  {(3^4 . 17)}^2$


gcd(N, (296 * 316) - (3^4 * 17)) = 587

So we have factorized N using just the 1st vector 

$87463 = 587 * 149$

The process actually ends here but let's try it again with the 2nd & 3rd vector also

gcd(N, (299 * 316 * 347) - (2 * 3^4 * 17^2 * 19)) = 587

gcd(N, (302 * 307 * 343) - (2 * 3^3 * 13 * 29 * 43)) = 587 

So all 3 gives us factorization (theoritically none of them may give it so we may have to sieve more numbers)
