title: zkSNARKs&#58; R1CS and QAP TMPPOST

{% include mathjax.html %}

This page explains how to take a computational problem & convert it first to a R1CS(Rank-1 Constraint System) form & from that to a QAP(Quadratic Arithmetic Progam) form. It does not touch on any other parts of zkSNARKs or even why we need to do these conversions. I am hoping to write on those in the future.  

Let's use Vitalik Buterin's now famous cubic equation $x^3 + x + 5 == 35$

If you were to write a program in some Python which takes an x value & evaluates the Left Hand Side of the equation, it would look something like

~~~python

def Evaluate(x):
    return x**3 + x + 5

~~~

We first decompose the above code into a series of much simpler operations. This step is called flattening.
In the flattened code, we are allowed only the following operations 

- Assignment i.e. var1 = var2 or constant
- Operation with an operator var1 = (var2 or constant) Operator (var3 or constant) 
The only operators allowed are +, -, \*, / 


The flattened code 
~~~python

def Evaluate(x):
    tmp1 = x * x 
    tmp2 = tmp1 * x 
    tmp3 = tmp2 + x
    out = tmp3 + 5
~~~
    
We skip the return statement in the flattened form & just assign the value to a variable "out".
