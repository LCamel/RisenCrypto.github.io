If you aren't familiar with Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields used in Cryptography, you can check out these videos   

- [Introduction to Elliptic Curves by Mike Pound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF1pwjL9-DE)
- [Introduction to Elliptic Curves by Chrisof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnpZXJL6QCQ)

The above videos cover Elliptic Curves over Prime Fields $F_p$ but not over Extension Fields $F_{p^k}$

Below we look at 2 things

- Polynomial Basis Representation for Extension Fields  

- Elliptic Curves over an Extension Field   


**Polynomial Basis Representation for Extension Fields**   

Let's look at Extension fields of the form $F_{2^k}$ - i.e. $F_{p^k}$ where $p = 2$. These are called as Binary Fields.

Here, the elements of $F_{2^k}$ are polynomials whose coefficients are in the field $F_2$ = {0,1}. The degree of the polynomial is less than or equal to $k − 1$

Each element $A(x)$ in $F_{2^k}$ would be of the form  $a_{k−1}x^{k−1} +a_{k−2}x^{k−2} +···+ a_{2}x^{2} +a_{1}x + a_0$ with a_i \in {0,1}$

Let's take $F_{2^4}$ - here the polynomials will be of the form $a_{3}x^3 + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_0$ with each coefficient $a_i$ being equal to either 0 or 1. Since each co-efficient of a polynomial is either 0 or 1, it's similar to a bit & all the co-efficients of one polynomial can be considered as a BitString or a vector space. For e.g. $x^3 + x + 1$ can be represented as the bit string (1011), $x^2 + x$ is (0101). In general, the finite field $F_{p^k}$ can be viewed as a vector space over its subfield $F_p$. 

The 16 polynomials in $F_{2^4}$ can be viewed as the bit representations of all the numbers {0, 1, ...., 15}
