If you aren't familiar with Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields used in Cryptography, you can check out these videos   

- [Introduction to Elliptic Curves by Dr. Mike Pound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF1pwjL9-DE)
- [Introduction to Elliptic Curves by Chrisof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnpZXJL6QCQ)

The above vidoes cover Elliptic Curves over Prime Fields $F_p$ but not over Extension Fields $F_{p^k}$

Below we will look at 2 things

- Polynomial Basis Representation for Extension Fields  
- Elliptic Curves over an Extension Field   


**Polynomial Basis Representation for Extension Fields**   

Let's look at Extension fields of the form $F_{2^m}$ - i.e. $F_{p^k}$ where $p = 2$. These are called as Binary Fields.

Here, the elements of $F_{2^m}$ are polynomials whose coefficients are in the field $F_2$ = {0,1}. The degree of the polynomial is less than or equal to $m − 1$

Each element $A(x) in $F_{2^m} would be of the form  $a_{m−1}x^{m−1} +a_{m−2}x^{m−2} +···+ a_{2}z^{2} +a_{1}z + a_0$ with a_i \in {0,1}$
