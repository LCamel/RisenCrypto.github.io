title: A different Algorithm for solving a special case of the Discrete Log Problem

---

{% include mathjax.html %}

The *Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm* helps solve the *Discrete Log Problem* for Finite Fields whose order can be factored into prime powers of smaller primes. The algorithm reduces the computation of the discrete log in the Finite Field $G$ to the computation of the discrete log in prime order subgroups of **⟨G⟩**
