A commitment scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are binding.

Polynomials are frequently used in cryptography because they can be used to encode a lot of information. A polynomial commitment scheme allows a committer to commit to a polynomial with a commitment string that can be used by a verifier to confirm claimed evaluations of the committed polynomial. We will look at one such PCS called KGZ (Kate, Zaverucha, Goldberg) Commitment. It's also referred to as the Kate Commitment scheme.
