Many cryptographic protocols use elliptic curves of prime order. However there are composite order curves like the Edwards Curve, Montgomery Curve etc which easily provide faster group operations with complete addition laws which are not vulnerable to a timing attack. So many modern elliptic curve implentations use a composite order curve of order $h.p$ where $p$ is a prime & $h$ is a small cofactor usually $8$ or lesser. The composite order curve has a subgroup of prime order $p$ which is used for the implementations. Though these curves have a lot of advantages, there are also some disadvantages, one of which we discuss below called as a small subgroup attack.

## Small Subgroup attack in non-prime order curves

The operations are usually implemented in the prime order subgroup of the full Curve. Let's take the example of Diffie Hellman to understand the small subgroup attack. Let's say our curve is of order $8p$ where $p$ is a prime & $8$ is the cofactor. Let $G$ be a generator of the prime order subgroup. Let $a$ & $b$ be Alice's & Bob's private keys respectively. This is how a typical Diffie Hellman key exchange works.

$$
\text{Alice} \xrightarrow{\hspace{3cm} a G \hspace{3cm}} \text{Bob} \\
\text{Alice} \xleftarrow{\hspace{3cm} b G \hspace{3cm}} \text{Bob}
$$

Alice calculates $a.bG$, Bob calculates $b.aG$ and the shared secret is derived from $abG$ by both parties.

If Bob is a malicious participant, he can launch a small subgroup attack which can leak some information about Alice's private key. The protocol depends on operating in the prime order subgroup (i.e. the subgroup of order $p$). Since $G$ is a generator of the large prime order subgroup, $abG$ also falls in the prime order subgroup (because of closure). But the full curve group also contains other subgroups - one of which is of order $8$. The points of the subgroup of order $8$ are not in the prime order subgroup (other than the identity). Let $H$ be a **generator** of the subgroup of order $8$. Now, Bab instead of sending $bG$ to Alice sends just $H$ to Alice.  So Alice calculates $aH$ & derives the share secret using that. Alice then encrypts a message using the shared secret & sends it to Bob. Now if Alice's shared secret had been derived from $abG$, then number of possible values $abG$ could have is $p$ which is a very large prime - for e.g. for $ed25519$, $p = 2^{252} + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493$ so brute forcing the encrypted message to recovered the shared secret is not possible. However, Bob has tricked Alice into deriving her shared secret from $aH$.  $H$ is a generator of subgroup of order $8$, $aH$ is a point of the subgroup of order $8$ because of closure in the subgroup. So $aH$ can only be one of $8$ points instead one of of $p$ points. Now brute forcing the secret key is much simpler for Bob. So Bob can recover $aH$. It's possible to recover the value of $a \bmod 8$ from $aH$ - which is the lower $3$ bits of of $a$.

To understand this better, let's take the example of a simple additive group of order $8p$ where $p = 11$ and the cofactor is $8$. This is the group $Z/{88Z}$. This has the elements $ \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 4, .... 87 \rbrace$ (I am omitting the coset notation for simplicity)

This has multiple subgroups including the subgroup of order $11$ - $\lbrace 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80 \rbrace$. The cofactor subgroup of order $8$ is $\lbrace 0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77 \rbrace$. 

Let the generator chosen for the DH exchange be $8$. So Alice would send $a.8$ & Bob would send $b.8$ & the shared secret would be derived from $ab8$. A malicious Bob instead of sending $b8$, sends a generator of the cofactor subgroup - i.e he sends $11$. So now Alice computes $11a$. Irrespective of what $a$ is chosen by Alice, $11a$ always is restricted to 8 different elements instead of $11$ different elements if Bob was a honest participant, then Alice's the shared secret would have been derived from $11a$ & she would have encrypted a message with it& sent it to Bob. Because of the attack, Bob now has to only bruteforce by doing an exhaustive search through $8$ different elements instead of $11$ different elements. In our toy example, reduction from $11$ to $8$ is not a significant reduction, but in the case of actual cryptographic curves, the reduction in search is huge - from searching through a really large set of size $p$ to searching through just $8$ points. 

If you iterate through all possible 88 values of $a$ & calculate $aH$, you will see that $ah$ computes into 8 different values depending on $a \bmod 8$.  
Alternately, you can derive a formula which gives you $a \bmod 8$ from $aH$
~~~
# writing it using sagemath functions
a mod 8 = mod(inverse_mod(Integer(mod(H,8), 8)) * mod(a*H, 88), 8)$ 
~~~
So that's the small subgroup attack.

There are also a couple of other similar attacks 

- Instead of sending $bG$, Bob can send $bG + H$ to Alice. So Alice now calculates $abG + aH$. Now since Bob knows $abG$, this again leaks $a \bmod 8$.

- Instead of Bob launching the above attack, a man in the middle (Mallory) could intercepts $bG$ sent by Bob & replaces it with $H$, then he can brute force the secret key generated by Alice ($aH$) because it can only be one of $8$ points.

In DH, leaking $a \bmod 8$ matters only if Alice reuses $a$. However, above attack is not limited to DH, but also applicable to many other Cryptographic protocols. In some protocols like like PAKE, MQV etc, the attack can have far worse effects.

## Mitigation for the small subgroup attack - cofactor clearing

Scalar multipliying any point by the cofactor ($8$ in this case) projects the point on to the prime order subgroup, irrespective of which subgroup it was in originally. This can be easily done by both parties - i.e. when Alice receives $bG$ from Bob, instead of computing $abG$, she can compute $8abG$ & likewise Bob does the same when gets $aG$ from Alice. Now if Bob is a malicious player, then what is leaked is $8a \bmod 8$ instead of $a \bmod 8$. Since $8a \bmod 8$ is always 0, nothing of significance is leaked. Mutliplying by $8$ clears the lower $3$ bits.  


Below is a sage program which takes all possible values of $a$ & scalar multiplies it by $8$. And you can see that after doing this, the output is always an element of the prime order subgroup. 

~~~
sage: L = [] # Initialize an empty lit
....: for i in range(88):  # Go through every element of the group
....:     out = mod(8*i, 88) # Scalar multiply by the cofactor
....:     if out not in L: # If output not already in output list 
....:         L.append(out) # append it to the list
....: L # Output the list after cofactor clearning
....:

[0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80] # **Output:** Any point in the full group when 
                         # scalar multipled by the cofactor maps to a prime order element
~~~

## Torsion safe cofactor clearing

The method of cofactor clearing by scalar multiplying by the cofactor works fine for many protocols but isn't suitable everywhere. 

A cyclic group $G_{mn}$ of order $mn$ where $m$ & $n$ are coprime is isomorphic to a product group $G_m \times G_n$. 
The map for this isomorphism is
$\phi (a, b) = na + mb$ where $a \in G_p, b \in G_8$

So our ellipic curve group $G_{8p}$ can be looked at as $G_8 \times G_p$. 

This means any point $Q$ on the full curve of order $8p$ can be written as the sum of 2 components i.e. the prime order component $P$ & a $8$-torsion component $T$ from the subgroup of order $8$ i.e $Q = 8P + pT$

Clearing the lower 3 bits of $P$ could change both the prime order component & also the 8-torsion component. This may not be appropriate in some places (for e.g. heirarchical key derivation schemes). In these cases, we need a "torsion-safe" method of cofactor clearing. 

If Alice's private key is $a$, we need to multiply it by some number to get a $a'$ such that, for a point $B$ in the prime order subgroup, $aB = a'B$, but for a torsion point $T$, $a'T = identity$. 

To understand how we can find such a $a'$, let's again use  the simple additive group we used earlier - i.e.  $Z/{88Z}$. For simplicity, I will omit the quotient group notation & refer to it as $Z_{88}$. 

$Z_{88} \cong Z_{11} \times Z_8$.

with

$\phi (a, b) = 8a + 11b$ where $a \in Z_{11}, b \in Z_8$

For e.g. $18 = (8.16 + 11.22)  \bmod {88}$

For the element $18$, $16$ is prime-order component & $22$ is the 8-torsion component. We want to clear the 8-torsion component without disturbing the prime order subgroup component.

We have to find a scalar $s$ such that when $11b$ is multiplied by it, it zeroes out. Any multiple of $8$ will do this.
A multiple of 8 can be expressed as 

$s = 0 \bmod 8$

The scalar should also leave $8a$ undisturbed. Any scalar of the form $11k + 1$ will leave $8a$ undisturbed . We can express this as

$s = 1 \bmod 11$

We can combine the above 2 congruences using Chinese Remainder Theorem to find $s$

~~~
sage: CRT_list([0,1], [8,11])
56
~~~

So $s = 56$.

So multipling by the scalar $56$ is a torsion safe method of cofactor clearing. You can modify the sage program used earlier to check if multiplying any element of the full Group results in an element of the prime subgroup. And if you decompose the element into it's components, you will see that $8$-torsion component is cleared while the other component remains unchanged.

Let's take the example of the element $33$ - this belongs to the subgroup of order $8$.

$33 =
