# Why Elliptic Curve Cryptography?  

**Q.** Why does modern cryptography prefer the discrete log problem on the group of points on an Elliptic Curve defined over a Finite Field rather than integer factorization or the discrete log problem over the multiplicative group of a Finite Field?

**A.** A cryptographic algorithm is said to have a security level of $n$ bits if the best known attack can break it in $2^n$ steps. So if the naive brute force/exhaustive search is the best known attack for any algorithm the security level will be same as the modulus size in bits. However most asymmetric algorithms have much better attacks than the naive attack & hence their security level is lesser than the size. For e.g. the Discrete Log problme on which Diffie Hellman is based on has a very powerful attack called as Index Calculus. To compensate for this attack, we have to use very large modulus in DH. To get 112 bit security DH neeeds a 2048 bit modulus. This is because of a very powerful attack known as Index Calculus which can attack the Discrete Log problem in sub-exponential time. The Index Calculus method uses smooth numbers. Likeiwise, the General Number Field Sieve for Integer Factorzation using Smooth numbers means RSA also requires a 2048 bit modulus to get 122 bit security.


The reason why ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) is preferred to DH (Diffie Hellman) or RSA is because ECDH with a 224 bit key size can achieve the same security as 2048 bit RSA or 2048 bit DH. Smaller key sizes means smaller space requirements & much faster operations. But why does ECC get by with smaller keys.
