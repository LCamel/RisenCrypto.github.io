Many cryptographic protocols use elliptic curves of prime order. However there are Composite order Curves like the Edwards Curve, Montgomery Curves which easily provide faster group operations with complete addition laws which are not vulnerable to a timing attack. So many modern elliptic curve implentations use a composite order curve with a small co-factor. The order of these curves is  $h.p$ where $p$ is a prime & $h$ is a small cofactor usually $8$ or lesser. The composite order curve has a subgroup of prime order $p$ which is used for the implementations. Though these curves have a lot of advantages, there are also some disadvantages one of which we discuss below called as a small subgroup attack.

## Small Subgroup attack in non-prime order curves

The operations are usually implemented in the prime order subgroup of the full Curve. Let's take the example of Diffie Hellman to understand the small subgroup attack.
Let $G$ be a generator of the prime order subgroup. 
$$
\text{Alice} \xrightarrow{\hspace{3cm} a G \hspace{3cm}} \text{Bob} \\
\text{Alice} \xleftarrow{\hspace{3cm} b G \hspace{3cm}} \text{Bob}
$$
