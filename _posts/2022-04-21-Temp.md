## Why Elliptic Curve Cryptography?  

**Q.** Why does modern cryptography prefer the discrete log problem over the additive group of points on an Elliptic Curve defined over a Finite Field rather than integer factorization or the discrete log problem over the multiplicative group of a Finite Field?

**A.** A cryptographic algorithm is said to have a security level of $n$ bits if the best known attack can break it in $2^n$ steps. So if the naive brute force/exhaustive search is the best known attack for any algorithm the security level will be same as the key size in bits. However most asymmetric algorithms have much better attacks than the naive attack & hence their security level is lesser than the key size. For e.g. the Discrete Log problem on which Diffie Hellman is based on has a very powerful attack called as Index Calculus, which can solve the Discrete Log problem in sub-exponential time. To compensate for this attack, we have to use very large key sizes in DH. To get 112 bit security, DH needs 2048 bit key size. Index Calculus uses smooth numbers. Likewise, the General Number Field Sieve for Integer Factorzation using smooth numbers means RSA also requires a 2048 bit key size to get 112 bit security.

Unlike the multiplicative group of a Finite Field, the group of Elliptic Curve points doesn't have a straightforward notion of smoothness & any methods similiar to Index Calculus haven't been discovered in this group. Hence in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, you can get 112 bit security with just 224 bit Key Size.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 {\text{Algorithm}} & {\text{Size}} \\\hline
 RSA & 2048 \\\hline
 DH & 2048 \\\hline
 ECDH & 224 \\\hline
\end{array}
$$

*Note:* For asymmetric algorithms like the above, key size typically refers to the size of the modulus.

So one can use an elliptic curve group that is smaller in size while maintaining the same level of security. In most situations, the result is smaller key sizes, bandwidth savings and faster operations. 

## The MOV attack

The MOV (Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone) attack transforms a Discrete Log problem in an Elliptic Curve Group into a Discrete Log Problem in the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field - i.e. DLP to ECDLP. Since Index Calclus is possible in DLP, it becomes easier to solve the DLP & thus solve the ECDLP.

*Some pre-requisites topics first*

### What is a bilinear map?

We can look at linear & bilinear maps using the example of Vector Spaces.

Let 

- $U, V, W$ be vector spaces 
- $\lbrace u, u_1, u_2  \in U \rbrace$ , $\lbrace v, v_1, v_2 \in V \rbrace$ 
- $\alpha$ is a scalar

$f_1 : V \mapsto W \space (f_1$ is a map from $V$ to $W$)
$f_1$ is a **linear map** if   

- $f_1(v_1, v_2) = f_1(v_1) + f_1(v_2)$   

- $f_1(\alpha v) = \alpha f_1(v)$ 



$f_2 : U$ X $V \mapsto W \space (f_2$ is a map from $U$ X $V$ to $W)\\\\$

$f_2$ is a **bilinear map** if 

- $f_2(u_1 + u_2, v) = f_2(u_1, v) + f_2(u_2, v)$

- $f_2(u, v_1 + v_2) = f_2(u, v_1) + f_2(u, v_2)$  

- $f_2(\alpha u, v) = \alpha f_2(u, v) = f_2(u, \alpha v)$

This means that the map is linear in $u$ if $v$ is fixed & is linear in $v$ if $u$ is fixed.


### Torsion Points

$E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a prime field $\mathbb F_q$. A point $P \in E(\mathbb F_p)$ satisfying $mP = \mathcal O$ is called a point of order $m$ in the group. The set of all points of order $m$ in the group is denoted by $E[m] = \lbrace P \in E : mP = \mathcal O \rbrace$ - i.e. the set of $m$-torsion points.


### Roots of Unity

$t$ is a $n$th root of unity if $t^n = 1$. If you are unfamiliar with "Roots of Unity", you can take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bme6sLcpYgA). 

However, the video talks about the complex roots of unity and not in other structures like a finite field. 

Let's consider roots of unity in a finite field of prime order say $\mathbb F_5 = \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$. Every element in this field except for $0$ when raised to $5-1$ .i.e when raised to $4$ gives $1$. For e.g. $3^4 \bmod 5 = 1$. So every element in the field $\mathbb F_5$ is a $4$th root of unity. This is because for any non zero element $a$ in finite field $\mathbb F_p$, we know that $a^p = a$ & hence $a^{p - 1} = 1$ by Lagrange's Theorem. So every element $a$ in a finite field of prime order $p$ is a $p-1$th root of unity. 

Next let's consider a Extension Fields, fields of prime power order i.e. $\mathbb F_{p^k}$

If $a \in \mathbb F_{p^k}, a \ne 0$. 

$a^p = a$. 

Raising both sides by $k$, 

${a^p}^k = a^k$

$\therefore a^{p^k - 1} = 1$.

Hence every non-zero element in an extension field also is a root of unity.

### The Weil Pairing 

The Weil Pairing is a map $e_m$ which takes as input a pair of $m$-torsion points $A, B \in E[m]$ (i.e. both $A$ & $B$ have order $m$). The map gives as output an *m*th root of unity $e_m(A,B)$. The output of the Weil Pairing when raised to $m$ always gives $1$ - i.e. ${e_m(A,B)}^m = 1$ for all $A, B \in E[m]$. 

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a prime field $\mathbb F_q$. Let $P$ be a point of order $m$ where $m$ is prime & is also coprime with $q$.

If $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that 

$q^k \equiv 1 \bmod m$

then $k$ is called as the embedding degree of the curve $E(\mathbb F_q)$ with respect to $m$.

From $q^k \equiv 1 \bmod m$, we get 

$q^k = mx + 1$ 

$\therefore q^k – 1 = mx$

$\therefore m$ divides $q^k – 1$

Consider the Extension Field $\mathbb F_{q^k}$. The multiplicative group of this extension field i.e. $\mathbb F^{\star}_{p^k}$ excludes the element $0$ and hence it's order is $q^k - 1$. Since $m$ divides the order of the multiplicative group, by the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, it has a unique subgroup $G$ of order $m$. The Weil pairing constructs an isomorphism from $\langle P \rangle$ (the group generated by $P$) to $G$ when the additional constraint $n \notin (q − 1)$ is satisfied.


These are the properties of the Weil Pairing

- **Bilinear:** 

&emsp;&ensp;The Right Hand Side of the Weil Pairing bilinearity is multiplicative rather than the additive bilinearity we saw earlier with Bilinear Maps of Vector Spaces.

&emsp;&ensp; $e_m(A_1 + A_2, B) = e_m(A_1, B).e_m(A_2,B)$

&emsp;&ensp;$e_m(A, B_1 + B_2) = e_m(A, B_1).e_m(A,B_2)$

For a scalar $\alpha$, 

&emsp;&ensp;$e_m(\alpha A, B) = e_m(A, B^{\alpha}) = {e_m(A, B)}^{\alpha}$

- **Identity:** 
 
&emsp;&ensp; $e_m(A, B) = 1$ for all $A \in E[m]$.

-  **Alternation:** 

&emsp;&ensp; $e_m(A,B) = e_m(A,B)^{-1}$ for all $A, B \in E[m]$.

- **Non-Degeneracy:**

&emsp;&ensp;$e_m(A, \mathcal O) = 1$ for all $A \in E[m]$

&emsp;&ensp;If $e_m(A, B) = 1$ for all  $B \in E[m]$, then it means $A = \mathcal O$

### Finally, the MOV Attack

Consider an Elliptic Curve $E$ over the field $(\mathbb F_q)$ 

We are given points $P$ & $Q$ both of order $m$ such that  

$Q = rP$ 

We have to find $r$. This is the Elliptic Curve Discrete Log problem.

**The Steps:**   

1) Compute the order of the Elliptic Curve over the Extension field i.e. $n = \text# E(\mathbb F_{q^k})$. Since the $m$-Torsion group of $E(\mathbb F_p)$, is a subgroup of $E(\mathbb F_{q^k})$, $m$ divides $n$ (Lagrange's Theorem)

2) Choose a random point $T \in E(\mathbb F_{p^k})$ such that $T \notin E(\mathbb F_p)$   

3) Compute $S = (\frac {n}{m}) T$. If $S = \mathcal O$, then go back to step 2 & chose another random point $T$. If it's not $\mathcal O$, then it's a point of order $m$ as shown below 

$S = (\frac {n}{m}) T$

$\therefore mS = nT$ 

Let $t$ be the order of $T$. By Lagrange's Theorem, $t$ divides the order of $E(\mathbb F_{q^k})$. i.e. $t$ divides $n$. So $n$ can be written as $n = dt$ for some $d$. 

$\therefore mS = dtT$

Since $tT = \mathcal O$, $dtT = \mathcal O$.

$\therefore mS = \mathcal O$ 

So the order of $S$ is $m$. 

4) Compute the Weil Pairing values 

$u = e_m(P, S) \in \mathbb F_{q^k}$   and  

$v = e_m(rP, S) \in \mathbb F_{q^k}$  ($rP$ is $Q$ which we know)

Since the Weil Pairing is bilinear & $r$ is a scalar,  

$v = {e_m(P, S)}^r$

Since $u = e_m(P, S)$, we get

$v = u^r$.  

This is the Discrete Log problem(DLP) in the multiplicative group of $F_{\mathbb p^k}$. So we have transformed the ECDLP  $Q = rP$ into the DLP problem $u = v^r$.

5) If $p^k$ is not too large, then then $u=v^r$ can be solved using Index Calculus & $r$ can be found. So we have solved $Q = rP$ 

## Mitigation 

To ensure that an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb F_q$ is immune to the MOV attack, it is sufficient to check that $m$, the order of the base point $P \in E(\mathbb F_q)$, does not divide $q^k − 1$ for all small $k$ for which the $DLP$ in $F^{\star}_{q^k}$ is considered tractable. If $n \gt 2160$, then it suffices to check this condition for all $k \in [1,20]$.

*The actual computation of the Weil Pairing using Rational Functions is beyond the scope of this post.*
