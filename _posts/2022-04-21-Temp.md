# Why Elliptic Curve Cryptography?  

**Q.** Why does modern cryptography prefer the discrete log problem on the group of points on an Elliptic Curve defined over a Finite Field rather than integer factorization or the discrete log problem over the multiplicative group of a Finite Field?

**A.** A cryptographic algorithm is said to have a security level of $n$ bits if the best known attack can break it in $2^n$ steps. So if the naive brute force/exhaustive search is the best known attack for any algorithm the security level will be same as the key size in bits. However most asymmetric algorithms have much better attacks than the naive attack & hence their security level is lesser than the size. For e.g. the Discrete Log problme on which Diffie Hellman is based on has a very powerful attack called as Index Calculus. To compensate for this attack, we have to use very large key sizes in DH. To get 112 bit security DH needs 2048 bit key size. This is because of a very powerful attack known as Index Calculus which can attack the Discrete Log problem in sub-exponential time. The Index Calculus method uses smooth numbers. Likeiwise, the General Number Field Sieve for Integer Factorzation using Smooth numbers means RSA also requires a 2048 bit key size to get 112 bit security.

Unlike the multiplicative group of a Finite Field, the group of Elliptic Curve points doesn't have a straightforward notion of smoothness & any methods similiar to Index Calculus hasn't been discovered in this group. Hence in Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can get 112 bit security with a 224 bit Key Size.
