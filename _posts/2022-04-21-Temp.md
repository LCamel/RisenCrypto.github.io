The *Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm* helps solve the *Discrete Log Problem* for Finite Fields whose order can be factored into prime powers of smaller primes. The algorithm reduces the computation of the discrete log in the Finite Field $G$ to the computation of the discrete log in prime power order subgroups of $G$

For e.g. Order of $\mathbb F(p)=p−1=p_1^{n_1}.p_2^{n_2}.p_3^{n_3}…$

The PH algorithm allows your solve the DLP in the smaller subgroups of order $p_1^{n_1}, p_2^{n_2}, p_3^{n_3}$ etc and then combine the solutions using the *Chinese Remainder Theorem* to get the solution for the original DLP.
